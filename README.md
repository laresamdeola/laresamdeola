My name is Lare(pronounced as LAH-RAY). I'm a Nigerian Developer. I am interested in building Web Applications for GenZ.
I’m currently mastering Javascript, the MERN stack, C++ and ruby. I'm falling more in love with Programming everyday. I'm also
a big fan of Control Flow, so I love building intelligent programs.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are human-centered, human-focused, fun, exciting, innovative and with a lot of zeitgeist. 
I'm currently building www.petnames.com , an intimate interaction web app that generates random petnames for your lover. The project is
currently in its first version and by August, I'd release the version 1.1. It's currently not open for code contributions, but it's very
much open for suggestions. By version 1.5, it would be open for code contributions and become fully open source.
