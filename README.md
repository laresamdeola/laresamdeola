My name is Lare(pronounced as LAH-RAY). I'm a Nigerian Developer. I am interested in building Web Applications for GenZ.
I’m currently mastering Javascript, the MERN stack, C++ and ruby. I'm falling more in love with Programming everyday. I'm also
a big fan of Control Flow, so I love building intelligent programs.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are human-centered, human-focused, fun, exciting, innovative and with a lot of zeitgeist.
